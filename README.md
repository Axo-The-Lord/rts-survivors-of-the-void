# RTS: SURVIVORS OF THE VOID

Hey there! This the official repository for **RTS: Survivors of the Void**, which is a Risk of Rain 1 mod based on Risk of Rain 2's *Survivors of the Void* DLC. It's dependent on the *RTS: Reborn* mod, which you can find [here](https://github.com/Axo-The-Lord/rts-reborn).

You can download WIP versions of the mod through the */dev* branch, or stable versions in the *releases*. You can also get the mod on [Rainfusion](https://rainfusion.ml). Please keep in mind that WIP versions can be very buggy - proceed with caution!

If you contribute to the mod, you'll have your name in the credits, get a special dev role in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/aruVgb6NNP), and have a custom particle effect in multiplayer games.

For more information on the mod, you can check out the detailed description on Rainfusion or reference the Rainfusion.md file.

That's it for here. This file is more or less meant to act as a development checklist that coders and artists alike can reference. Unlike RTS, I'm not dividing this into designated updates - work on anything you please, and as soon as it's finished we'll bundle it up and send it over to Rainfusion.
